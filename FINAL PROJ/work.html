            <h3>Magazine</h3>
            <p>Graphic Design 2 - Spring Semester 2023 8.5” x 11”
              Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign</p>
              <p> The goal of this project was to create a magazine on the topic of our choice. This offered us the freedom to create an issue that we were passionate about. In our magazine, we had to include one large article, two short articles, an infographic, icons, experimental type, and images. In a modernistic and vintage style, I chose to highlight my favorite band, Fleetwood Mac. I wanted the viewer to feel as though they could pick this up in either 1973 or 2023. As a result, I highlighted the integrity and styles that would have been prevalent in both periods.</p>

              Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator</p>
              <p>The objective of this project was to develop festival branding based on the provided prompt, focusing on 'The Liqueur Odyssey.' This festival catered to an older audience, encompassing millennials and beyond, and was hosted in Italy. I opted for a palette featuring light shades of yellows and browns to maintain a sophisticated and mature aesthetic for the brand.</p>

              <p>As the Graphic Design Club’s Social Media Chair, I am tasked with creating our identity. This includes making a group logo and uploading posts. I wanted to keep the integrity of ISU’s colors and branding, with a vintage twist. My goal is to attract more members and hopefully catch the eye of a passive scroller</p>

              <p>Matryoshka Dolls, or 'Russian nesting dolls,' are iconic in Russian culture and commonly found in stores, including some in the United States. Beyond being toys, they are prized collectibles and souvenirs, meticulously hand-painted for a sophisticated touch. Crafting involves intricate planning, precise woodwork with linden trees, shaping with wood turners, adherence to strict painting guidelines, varnishing, and a quality check before reaching store shelves.</p>

              <p>For this project, the assignment was to watch a documentary and produce a book based on the information presented. I opted for 'A Trip to Infinity,' available on Netflix, and designed the book with a focus on the scientific theme, ensuring to maintain the documentary's integrity throughout.</p>
